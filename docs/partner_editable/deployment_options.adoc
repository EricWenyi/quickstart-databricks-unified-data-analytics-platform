// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides three deployment options:

* Create a multi-workspace environment configured with a Databricks-managed VPC.
* Create a multi-workspace environment configured with a Databricks-managed VPC with an optional customer-managed key for notebooks. 
* Create a multi-workspace environment configured with an optional customer-managed key for notebooks and optional existing customer-managed VPC.

The Quick Start provides different parameters in master template for these options.
