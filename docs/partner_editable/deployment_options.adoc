// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

Databricks needs access to a cross-account IAM role in your AWS account to launch clusters into the VPC of the new workspace. This Quick Start provides the following two deployment options:

* Deploy a Databricks workspace and create a *new* cross-account IAM role. You must have sufficient permissions to create a new IAM role.

* Deploy a Databricks workspace and use an *existing* cross-account IAM role. You can create an appropriate role and policy for your deployment type by following these https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/iam-role.html[steps]. By selecting the second deployment option, you will also need an additional IAM role with the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy.
