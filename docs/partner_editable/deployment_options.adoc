// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

Databricks needs access to a cross-account IAM role in your AWS account to launch clusters into the VPC of the new workspace. This Quick Start provides the following two deployment options:

* Deploy a Databricks workspace and create a *new* cross-account IAM role. You must have sufficient permissions to create a new IAM role.

* Deploy a Databricks workspace and use an *existing* cross-account IAM role. You can create an appropriate role and policy for your deployment type by following these https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/iam-role.html[steps]. For this deployment option, you will need an additional IAM role with the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy as follow:

        {
            "Sid": "CloudWatch",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
