As shown in <<architecture1>>, this deployment sets up the following in your AWS account:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.
* A customer managed VPC configured with public subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.**
* In the public subnets:
** Databricks workspace instances.
** Security groups to enable secure cluster connectivity.
* An S3 bucket to store objects such as cluster logs, notebook revisions, and job results.
* Amazon CloudWatch Logs for the Databricks workspace instance logs.
* A customer managed AWS KMS key to encrypt notebooks in the control plane.*
* A cross-account IAM role to enable Databricks to deploy clusters in the appropriate VPC for the new workspaces.

The Databricks managed VPC in the Databricks AWS account can securely connect to the VPC in your AWS account.

*The components marked by asterisks are created when an AWS KMS key ID is provided.

**The components marked by double asterisks are created when no VPCID is provided.
