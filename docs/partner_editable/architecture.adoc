As shown in <<architecture1>>, this deployment sets up the following in your AWS account:

* A highly available architecture that spans at least three Availability Zones.
* A Databricks managed VPC configured with private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.**
* In the private subnets:**
** Databricks workspace instances.
** Security groups to enable secure cluster connectivity.
* An S3 bucket to store objects such as cluster logs, notebook revisions, and job results.
* Amazon CloudWatch Logs for the Databricks workspace instance logs.
* A customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt notebooks in the control plane.*
* A cross-account IAM role enabling Databricks to deploy clusters in the appropriate VPC for the new workspaces. Depending on the deployment option you choose, you either create this IAM role during deployment or use an existing IAM role.
