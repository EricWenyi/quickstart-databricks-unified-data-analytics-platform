As shown in Figure 1, this deployment sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.**
* A cross-account IAM role, so that Databricks can deploy clusters in the appropriate VPC for the new workspace.
* An S3 bucket required to store objects like cluster logs, notebook revisions, and job results.
* A Databricks workspace.
* A customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt notebooks in the control plane.*
* Security groups to enable secure cluster connectivity.

*The components marked by asterisks are created when KMS Key Id is provided.

**The components marked by double asterisks are created when VPCID isn't provided.
