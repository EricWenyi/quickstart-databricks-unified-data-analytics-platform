As shown in <<architecture1>>, this deployment sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.

* In customer's AWS Account:
** A VPC configured with public subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.**
** In the public subnets:
*** Databricks workspace instances.
*** Security groups to enable secure cluster connectivity.
** An S3 bucket required to store objects like cluster logs, notebook revisions, and job results.
** Amazon CloudWatch logs for the Databricks workspace instance logs.
** A customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt notebooks in the control plane.*
** A cross-account IAM role, so that Databricks can deploy clusters in the appropriate VPC for the new workspace.

*The components marked by asterisks are created when an AWS KMS key ID is provided.

**The components marked by double asterisks are created when VPCID isn't provided.
