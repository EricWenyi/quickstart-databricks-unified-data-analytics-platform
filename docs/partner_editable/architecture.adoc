* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.**
* A unique cross-account service IAM role in your AWS account so that Databricks can deploy clusters in the appropriate VPC for the new workspace.
* An S3 bucket in your account required to store objects like cluster logs, notebook revisions, and job results.
* A Databricks workspace.
* A customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt notebooks in the control plane.*
* Enable secure cluster connectivity.

*The components marked by asterisks are created when KMS Key Id is provided.
