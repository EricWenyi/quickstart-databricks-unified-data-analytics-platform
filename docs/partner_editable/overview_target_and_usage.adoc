This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying {partner-product-name} workspaces on the AWS Cloud.

Databricks is a unified data-analytics platform for data engineering, machine learning, and collaborative data science. A https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/index.html[Databricks workspace^] is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) environment for accessing all your Databricks assets. The workspace organizes objects (notebooks, libraries, and experiments) into folders and provides access to data and computational resources, such as clusters and jobs.

//TODO Shivansh, Since "unified" is an important enough word to put in our repo's URL, and we mention it in the first sentence here (and it's part of the official product name), please clarify what Databricks means by "unify." What exactly does this platform bring together?

This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who want to use the Databricks API to create Databricks workspaces on the AWS Cloud. This Quick Start creates a new multiworkspace environment in your AWS account.
